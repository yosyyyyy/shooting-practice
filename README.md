Title: Unitychan's Shooting Practice!

Genre: Bullet Hell

Controls: Arrow keys to move (left-shift key to slow down).

This is my first game created during the process of learning C# and Unity.

The objective is very simple. Avoid bullets and destroy monsters.

The game consists of 4 stages, but you can proceed to the 5th stage if your score is good. Less misses result in better score.

It basically starts from the 1st stage, but if you hold down number keys (1-5) when you choose difficulty, you can start from the specific stage (for practice).
